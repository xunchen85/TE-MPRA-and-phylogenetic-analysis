# TE-MPRA-and-phylogenetic-analysis
The scripts here are used for the study of "Cryptic endogenous retrovirus subfamilies in the primate lineage". The inputs are available upon request (chen.xun.3r@kyoto-u.ac.jp) and the final version will be available on Zenodo.


All Python, R, and shell scripts will be finalized and uploaded asap...

1. Run_MPRAflow.sh script was used to compute the MPRA activity using MPRAflow, MPRAnalyze, and several R scripts.

2. Run_phylogenetic_analysis.sh script was used to perform the TE phylogenetic analysis based on multiple sequence alignment.
