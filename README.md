# TE-MPRA-and-phylogenetic-analysis
The scripts here are used for the study of "Cryptic endogenous retrovirus subfamilies in the primate lineage".

All Python, R, and shell scripts will be finalized and uploaded asap...

1. Run_MPRAflow.sh script was used to compute the MPRA activity using MPRAflow, MPRAnalyze, and several R scripts.

2. Run_phylogenetic_analysis.sh script was used to perform the TE phylogenetic analysis based on multiple sequence alignment.
